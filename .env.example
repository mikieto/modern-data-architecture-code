# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named `.env` in the same directory (root of the repository).
# 2. Fill in your actual AWS credentials and preferred region in the `.env` file.
# 3. IMPORTANT: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your secrets!
#    (A .gitignore file including .env is already provided in this repository).
# 4. Choose EITHER Option A OR Option B below for providing credentials.
#    Uncomment the relevant lines for your chosen option and fill in your values.
#    Comment out the lines for the option you are NOT using.
#
# For detailed instructions, refer to the main README.md file.
#

# --- AWS Credentials ---
# Choose EITHER Option A (Recommended) OR Option B

# Option A: Temporary AWS Security Credentials (Highly Recommended for better security)
# Obtain these using AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), `aws sts assume-role`, or other methods. They expire.
# Fill in all three values if using this option.
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_TEMP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_TEMP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
# AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_HERE

# Option B: Long-term AWS Access Keys (Use with caution, ensure your IAM user has least privilege)
# Use only if temporary credentials are not feasible. Ensure AWS_SESSION_TOKEN above is commented out.
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE


# --- AWS Default Region ---
# Specify the AWS region where resources will be created by default.
# We use 'us-east-1' (N. Virginia) as a general-purpose default.
# ** Feel free to change this to your preferred AWS region! **
# Examples: us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-south-1, etc.
# Ensure the region you choose supports the AWS services used in the book's exercises.
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1


# --- Docker Compose Specific Variables (Optional) ---
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=mda-hands-on

# --- AWS Profile (Optional - Use ONLY if mounting ~/.aws via docker-compose.yml was re-enabled) ---
# If using the (now removed from default compose file) method of mounting ~/.aws and want to use a specific profile.
# AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
